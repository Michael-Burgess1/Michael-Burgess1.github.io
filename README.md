## About Me
I am a MS student in the UConn EEB department
interested in studying the life history characteristics of anadromous fish, and how changes in the global climate could impact their ability to move from freshwater spawning grounds to the marine habitat. I am particularly interested in learning more about the challenges faced by river herring (collectively alewives and blueback herring). I aim to produce work that deepen our understanding of the obstacles these fish face, and use this information to lead conservation efforts going forward.
